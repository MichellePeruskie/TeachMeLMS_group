# TeachMeLMS Group Project for Coding Dojo

## Description
A full-stack learning management system built with a Python framework integrating a YouTube API to create, manage and track custom online courses for any subject. A group project for Coding Dojo.

●	Built with a Django framework, TeachMe includes both admin and user portals. An admin superuser may create courses from videos directly off YouTube’s site, add accompanying quizzes and add/edit users.  A user has a profile, may create playlists and add lessons and take quizzes. Course completion is then tracked on the user’s profile.   

●	My part was half of the front-end framework development. I did the styling for the site:  CSS, integrated Bootstrap, HTML, and some JavaScript. I also worked to connect the front end to the backend on the homepage and profile page.
